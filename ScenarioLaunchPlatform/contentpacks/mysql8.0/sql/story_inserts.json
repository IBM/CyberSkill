This story runs in the following flow. 1. Polly our systems admin creates a stored proceedure. Sometime later (8 seconds), 2. Jason, a standard user calls that stored proceedure. Sometime later (4 seconds) 3. Liher our evil admin drops and recreates the stored proceedure with the same name as the original stored proceedure but now it includes malicious intent (drop table). Some time later (4 seconds) 4. John, a standard user calls this malicious stored procedure unaware of the change.",
