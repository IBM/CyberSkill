	-- Reporting entities
	<what>This level tasks the user with evading more advanced filtering techniques typically used to defend against XSS. Eventhough the XSS filter employed here is more advanced than many rudimentary filters, it is still based on a general bad practise (blacklisting) and can be defeated.</what> -- What was this level about
	<whatImage></whatImage> Image to accompany What Blurb if needed
	<why>By solving this XSS example the user learns that even advanced blacklisting filtering used to protect against XSS can be defeated. The objective of this learning exercise is to reinforce to the learner that basing security controls on known bad practise is not a sound defensive strategy.</why> -- Why is the user learning about this in the first place

	<how>By solving this challenge the user learns that code obfuscation techniques can be applied to aid a hacker in evading substandard XSS filtering.</how> -- How did they achieve the learning out come of this level

	<summary>Solving a more advanced XSS challenge illustrates to the user that even more advanced XSS defenses can be circumvented if the defense is not based on best security practises.</summary> -- What why and how summarized
